The respository analyze the whatsapp text which produces a flirt percentage of the chaters.

### Step 1:  Export interested whatsapp chat to mail. From mail you can download as .txt file which will be the input for the process

## Note:Step 2 &  Step 3 for Python Beginners(Optional for others)

### Step 2: Download Anaconda Distribution from the below link ###

click  this https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section 
According to your operating System Download the distribution and install( can refer any youtube videos)

### Step 3: Creating Virtual Environment ###

After the installation of Anaconda, type Anaconda prompt in the windows search bar 

    1. Anaconda Prompt --> Right Click --> Run as Administrator 

    2. conda create -n <project name>

Example:
     conda create -n nlp

    3.After this step closes the Anaconda Prompt.

    4. Again open

    $(base)D:\er\# activate nlp
    (nlp)D:\er\# pip install numpy
    (nlp)D:\er\# pip install nltk
    (nlp)D:\er\# pip install chardet
    (nlp)D:\er\# pip install pandas
    (nlp)D:\er\# pip install matplotlib
    (nlp)D:\er\# pip install spyder=3.2.3 (This will install Python 3.6.8)
    
    
###Step 4: Run interested python code(with emoji, without emoji)
 
  Output of the program
  1) Talkative
  2) Less_Talkative
  3) Flirt word used by each(if only)
  4) Flirt percentage for each(if they used)

Note: I have added limited flirt words in the list, please add more for effective process.

## Conclusion:
Analysed the text using pandas and statistics
